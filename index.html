            I like tweaking/tinkering things. If I found something interesting, I'll do anything to disassemble it to know how it works. That's why my Mom is always mad at me as most of my toys are already broken after a few days. I'm also thinking that this is the reason why I'm taking computer science right now.

            I like cats (more portable than dogs, and also cute), (dark) chocolate, typing (it's so satisfying to hear keyboard clicking sounds), art, and anything related to technology.

        <p class="sec-p">
        ...who always get nervous when talking in front of other people because some wirings in my brain that are responsible with communication are tangled so I'm not good at organizing and packaging my thoughts (<i>which is a huge disadvantage for me as recitation is now included in grading system based on new memo, but I'm trying</i>). But I'm somewhat ok with writing.</p>
